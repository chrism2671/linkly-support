<p>You can use third-party retargeting pixels with Linkly.</p>
<p>For example, you may wish to track users who have clicked on a link, and then serve them retargeted ads via Google Display Network, Facebook Ads or any other ad system that supports retargeting.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-retargeting">What is Retargeting?</h2>
<p>Have you ever noticed how when you visit a product page on the internet, somehow ads seem to show up for the product for weeks afterwards, on other unrelated sites?</p>
<p>This is because of retargeting.</p>
<p>When you visited the original product page, you were recorded as showing interest in that product. The owner of that site can now buy ads across the internet, and target you specifically, reminding you this product exists.</p>
<p>Retargeting is extremely effective, and is generally an order of magnitude cheaper per conversion than conventional ad targeting.</p>
